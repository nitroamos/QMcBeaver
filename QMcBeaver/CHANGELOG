1.  In QMCManager and QMCFlags, I made sure the iseed is always a negative
    integer whenever an input, restart, or checkpoint file is written or read.
    Previously, when a checkpoint or restart file was written, the current
    value of iseed, which during a run is a positive integer, was written.
    This was a problem for restarting parallel jobs from checkpoints because
    ran1() sets the iseed to 1 if it is positive, so all the processors were
    getting the same sequence of numbers.
    When writing restarts and checkpoints, -1*iseed is written out if
    iseed is positive.  I was careful not to change the value of iseed itself.

2.  In QMCManager, I fixed the conditional statement for writing out
    correlated sampling configurations.  Previously, it was writing out
    configs on every iteration, which caused very large files in the temp
    directory and very slow line search optimizations.  Now it writes out
    configs at the proper interval.
