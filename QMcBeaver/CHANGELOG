1.  Implemented multi determinant wavefunctions for the SCF part of the trial
    function.  The most substantial changes are in QMCSlater and QMCFunctions.
    MSCSF trial functions can be calculated using GAMESS with CANONC=.FALSE. in
    the $MCSCF section.

1) fixed a bug in Array2D.h in the matrix-matrix multiply function

2) finally submitted all the changes necessary to run QMcBeaver on Windows. I
   also added a folder "windows" in the top directory containing Visual Studio 
   project files. I tried my best to make sure that all the paths in those 
   files are relative...
   The project files will run the simple ..\examples\H2_hf_631Gss-vmc.ckmf 
   example I also added. To change which input file to use, change the entry in
   the menu bar at Project/QMcBeaver 
   Properties/Configuration Properties/Debugging/Command Arguments

  *note: I spent some time trying to force Visual Studio to make the CVS code 
  format nicely.
  There is a significant discrepancy between how VS and Emacs interpret tabs in
  the code. I tried to make as few formatting changes possible so as not to 
  mess up the code for everyone else...

1. Fixed the comments in the AngleDistributions, RadialDistributions, Array1D, 
   QMCDansWalkerInitialization, QMCEquilibrationArray, QMCExtendedProperties, 
   QMCGreensRatioComponent, QMCProperties, QMCProperty, QMCRun, and QMCWalker 
   classes to work with the JavaDoc documentation.

1. Improved the output formatting.  For some cases, the columns of 
   numbers would run together.

2. Added Doxygen documentation to the files generated for a release.

3. Added support for GCC 3.4.

Wed, 13 Oct 2004, Chip Kent

1. Improved the script to build official releases so that it appends the
   version number to the directory.

2. Added an example input file directory with a few entries.

1.  In the constructor function for QMCWalker, set the trial step size, dR2,
    to 0.  It was being used uninitialized and causing problems with the 
    calculation of the effective time step.

2.  In QMCManager::writeEnergyResultsSummary(ostream & strm), added the total
    number of samples collected to the results summary.  

3.  In QMcBeaver.cpp, added a Total Samples heading for the column with the 
    total number of samples in the global results.

1.  Got rid of the need to read the distributions from files in 
    QMCDansWalkerInitialization by using CubicSplines.  The resulting method is
    much faster.  The distributions are now stored in the AngleDistributions 
    and RadialDistributions classes.

1.  Changed configure.py to include settings for the cray_x1 computer.

2.  Added the class QMCGreensRatioComponent.  The Greens function
    calculations were causing numerical overflow problems for large
    molecules.  This class keeps track of a quantity of the form
    k*a^b*exp(c), which is the form of the Greens function components
    in the importance sampling parts of the code.

1. Included Amos Anderson's changes to improve the formatting of
   the output.  These changes make the output much easier to read.

1. Included Amos Anderson's changes to the build procedure.  These changes
   make it possible to remove the annoying src/Makefile.dep file which 
   constantly changes in CVS.  In addition, the new build procedure makes
   it possible to build for multiple systems using the same code base.

1.  Submitted changes on behalf of Amos Anderson fixing 
    calculateReverseGreensFunctionUmrigar93ImportanceSampling() in QMCWalker.
    The distances were being calculated from the proposed positions instead of
    the original positions, which was causing a very high acceptance 
    probability.  


Thurs, 15 July 2004, Daniel R. Fisher

1.  Changed the call to isnan() in QMCEquilibrationArray to come from 
    the IeeeMath class instead of <math.h>.  The previous function was not 
    compiling on some systems.

1.  Added QMCEquilibrationArray.  This defines an array of
    QMCExtendedProperties objects, each of which consists of a
    QMCProperties object and equilibration and propagation
    Stopwatches.  The ith element of the array starts collecting
    statistics on the (2^i)th iteration of the run.  When the
    properties are gathered, the element of the array with the
    smallest standard deviation for the total energy is chosen and
    sent to the root processor.  
    When the timing information is collected, the propagation and
    equilibration timers from the appropriate QMCExtendedProperties
    object are added to the localTimers and sent to the root
    processor.
    When correlated sampling configurations are read, each processor
    determines how many configurations from the beginning of the file
    should be skipped.  
    To use the equilibration array, set the flag
    use_equilibration_array to 1.

1.  Added QMCDansWalkerInitialization.  This initialization method requires
    very few equilibration steps before statistics can be gathered.  To use it,
    set the walker_initialization_method flag to dans_walker_initialization and
    copy radial_dist_arrays and angle_dist_arrays from the QMcBeaver/src 
    directory into the working directory.
    As part of this method, I added some quaternion operations for calculating
    rotations to Array1D.h.

2.  Added an equilibration Stopwatch to QMCStopwatches.  The time spent
    equilibrating the chain is now referred to as "equilibration time" and is
    recorded by the equilibration Stopwatch.  The Stopwatch that used to record
    this time was called the initialization Stopwatch.  This Stopwatch now 
    records the time spent generating an initial configuration for the 
    electrons.

1.  In QMCManager and QMCFlags, I made sure the iseed is always a negative
    integer whenever an input, restart, or checkpoint file is written or read.
    Previously, when a checkpoint or restart file was written, the current
    value of iseed, which during a run is a positive integer, was written.
    This was a problem for restarting parallel jobs from checkpoints because
    ran1() sets the iseed to 1 if it is positive, so all the processors were
    getting the same sequence of numbers.
    When writing restarts and checkpoints, -1*iseed is written out if
    iseed is positive.  I was careful not to change the value of iseed itself.

2.  In QMCManager, I fixed the conditional statement for writing out
    correlated sampling configurations.  Previously, it was writing out
    configs on every iteration, which caused very large files in the temp
    directory and very slow line search optimizations.  Now it writes out
    configs at the proper interval.
