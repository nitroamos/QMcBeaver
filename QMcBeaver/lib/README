This README discusses some issues about using ATLAS.

This directory is meant to hold the ATLAS libraries libatlas.a and libcblas.a.
(Perhaps it would be a good idea to provide the P3 Linux library common to the wolfs/matrix/borg? for now, they're in my amosa@wag directory.)

To get these two libraries, you need to either find a precompiled version online, or compile it from source yourself because
then you can get the most up to date version.
There are some standard places you could look for precompiled libraries:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas/
http://www.netlib.org/atlas/archives/

To compile the ATLAS library:
1) get the source from https://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas/
2) follow it's instructions for compiling the library (they're easy). If it has some settings for
your CPU already, then the build should be under 1 hr. On my P4 computer, it took around 45 minutes. If it doesn't
have settings for you (or you want it to refigure the settings out), it can take upwards of 5 or 6 hours (on my OSX G4 laptop) because
it tunes each function. if you do compile on OSX, you'll need to download and compile a fresh GNU compiler (the Apple modified ones
don't work for some reason. it would actually be quicker to use the later-discovered vecLib framework)
3) find the required libraries and plop them in this folder. the header files are standard and included in the QMcBeaver CVS.

To run with ATLAS:
1) select the --atlas option from the configure.py script.
2) if you do not want to run with ATLAS, don't select the --atlas option and the makefiles will NOT search for the 2 libraries.
