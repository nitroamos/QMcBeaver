The example input files in this directory are just to 
provide complex input examples that run for relatively
short periods of time.  The parameters are not configured
to give good results in any reasonable period of time.

The runs here are so short that error calculations are
impossible and unstable.  Don't be surprised if you
see NaN's appearing in these calculations.
