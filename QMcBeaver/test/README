To test your QMcBeaver.x, step into the QMcBeaver/test directory and run:

../bin/test.pl ../bin/QMcBeaver.x

And it will compare the results from QMcBeaver.x with the reference
results in this directory. The reference was produced by this QMcBeaver:

Compiler version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-8),
LAPACK 3.1.1, GotoBLAS 1.17, and run on "hive", a
Intel Dual-Core Xeon Processor 5100 (Woodcrest), 65nm

This testing system is new, so I don't know how much of an
error to expect when running on different systems. Double precision
error would be approximately 1.0e-15. If only one test fails, then you
might want to inspect the reference and new .out files directly.

I've added several tests, and I've put descriptions of the tests
on the first line of their ckmf file.
