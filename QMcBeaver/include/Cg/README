To run with Cg, you need to get the Cg Headers, which are available in the Cg Toolkit.

The only one specifically mentioned in the GPUQMC code is:
#include <cg/cgGL.h>

But it references many of the others.
In my Windows set up, the Toolkit includes:
cgGL.h
cg.h
cg_profiles.h
cg_datatypes.h
cg_bindlocations.h
cg_errors.h
cg_enums.h
cgGL_profiles.h

And these are possibly not needed, but included anyway:
cgProgramManager.h
cgTemplates.h
cgContextManager.h
cgD3D.h
cgD3D9.h
cgD3D8.h
